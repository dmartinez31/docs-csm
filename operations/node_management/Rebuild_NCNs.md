# Rebuild NCNs

Rebuild a master, worker, or storage non-compute node (NCN). Use this procedure in the event that a node has a hardware failure, or some other issue with the node has occurred that warrants rebuilding the node.

The following is a high-level overview of the NCN rebuild workflow:
1. [Prepare Node](#prepare_nodes)
   * There is a different procedure for each type of node (worker, master, and storage).
1. [Identify Node and Update Metadata](#identify_node_and_update_metadata)
   * Same procedure for all node types.
1. [Rebuild Node](#rebuild_node)
   * Same for master and worker nodes, but different for storage nodes.
1. [Validation](#validation)
   * There is a different procedure for each type of node (worker, master, and storage).

## Prerequisites

The system is fully installed and has transitioned off of the LiveCD.

## Procedure

<a name="prepare_nodes"></a>

### 1. Prepare Node

Only follow the steps in the section for the node type that is being rebuilt:

- [Worker node](#prepare-worker-node)
- [Master node](#prepare-master-node)
- [Storage node](#prepare-storage-node)

<a name="prepare-worker-node"></a>

#### 1.1. Prepare Worker Node

Prepare a worker node before rebuilding it.

Skip this section if rebuilding a master or storage node. The examples in this section assume the worker node with a hostname of `NODE` and component name of `XNAME` is being rebuilt. Unless otherwise noted, these commands can be run on any node in the system.

1. Determine if the worker being rebuilt is running the `cray-cps-cm-pm` pod.

    If the `cray-cps-cm-pm` pod is running, there will be an extra step to redeploy this pod after the node is rebuilt.

    ```bash
    ncn# cray cps deployment list --format json | grep -C1 podname
        "node": "ncn-w002",
        "podname": "cray-cps-cm-pm-j7td7"
      },
    --
        "node": "ncn-w001",
        "podname": "cray-cps-cm-pm-lzbhm"
      },
    --
        "node": "ncn-w003",
        "podname": "NA"
      },
    --
        "node": "ncn-w004",
        "podname": "NA"
      },
    --
        "node": "ncn-w005",
        "podname": "NA"
      }
    ```

    In this case, the `ncn-w001` and `ncn-w002` nodes have the pod.

    A `404 Not Found` error is expected when the Content Projection Service (CPS) is not installed on the system. CPS is part of the COS product so if this worker node is being rebuilt before the COS product has been installed, CPS will not be installed yet.

1. Retrieve the `XNAME` for the node being removed.

   This xname is available on the node being rebuilt in the following file:

   ```bash
   ncn# ssh NODE cat /etc/cray/xname
   ```

1. Confirm what the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) configurationStatus is for the desiredConfig before shutting down the node.

    The following command will indicate if a CFS job is currently in progress for this node. Replace the `XNAME` value in the following command with the xname of the node being rebuilt.

    ```bash
    ncn# cray cfs components describe XNAME --format json
    {
      "configurationStatus": "configured",
      "desiredConfig": "ncn-personalization-full",
      "enabled": true,
      "errorCount": 0,
      "id": "x3000c0s7b0n0",
      "retryPolicy": 3,
    ```

    If the configurationStatus is `pending`, wait for the job finish before rebooting this node. If the configurationStatus is `failed`, this means the failed CFS job configurationStatus preceded this worker rebuild, and that can be addressed independent of rebuilding this worker. If the configurationStatus is `unconfigured` and the NCN personalization procedure has not been done as part of an install yet, this can be ignored.

1. Drain the node to clear any pods running on the node.

    The following command will both cordon and drain the node. If there are messages indicating that the pods cannot be evicted because of a pod distribution budget, note those pod names and manually delete them.

    ```bash
    ncn# kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets --delete-local-data NODE
    ```

    You may run into pods that cannot be gracefully evicted due to Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB), for example:

    ```bash
    error when evicting pod "<pod>" (will retry after 5s): Cannot evict pod as it would violate the pod's disruption budget.
    ```

       In this case, there are some options. First, if the service is scalable, you can increase the scale to start up another pod on another node, and then the drain will be able to delete it. However, it will probably be necessary to force the deletion of the pod:

       ```bash
       ncn-m# kubectl delete pod [-n <namespace>] --force --grace-period=0 <pod>
       ```

       This will delete the offending pod, and Kubernetes should schedule a replacement on another node. You can then rerun the kubectl drain command, and it should report that the node is drained

       ```bash
       ncn-m# kubectl drain --ignore-daemonsets=true --delete-local-data=true NODE
       ```

1. Remove the node from the cluster after the node is drained.

    ```bash
    ncn-m# kubectl delete node NODE
    ```

<a name="prepare-master-node"></a>

#### 1.2. Prepare Master Node

Prepare a master node before rebuilding it.

Skip this section if rebuilding a worker or storage node. The examples in this section assume with the master node with the hostname of `NODE` and component name of `XNAME` is being rebuilt. The commands should be run on a master node that is remaining in the cluster.

1. Retrieve the `XNAME` for the node being removed.

   This xname is available on the node being rebuilt in the following file:

   ```bash
   ncn# ssh NODE cat /etc/cray/xname
   ```

1. Confirm what the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) configurationStatus is for the desiredConfig before shutting down the node.

   The following command will indicate if a CFS job is currently in progress for this node. Replace the `XNAME` value in the following command with the xname of the node being rebuilt.

   ```bash
   ncn# cray cfs components describe XNAME --format json
   {
     "configurationStatus": "configured",
     "desiredConfig": "ncn-personalization-full",
     "enabled": true,
     "errorCount": 0,
     "id": "x3000c0s7b0n0",
     "retryPolicy": 3,
   ```

   If the configurationStatus is `pending`, wait for the job finish before rebooting this node. If the configurationStatus is `failed`, this means the failed CFS job configurationStatus preceded this worker rebuild, and that can be addressed independent of rebuilding this worker. If the configurationStatus is `unconfigured` and the NCN personalization procedure has not been done as part of an install yet, this can be ignored.

1. Determine if the master node being rebuilt is the first master node.

   The first master node is the node others contact to join the Kubernetes cluster. If this is the node being rebuilt, promote another master node to the initial node before proceeding. Run the following command from any master node:

   ```bash
   ncn# craysys metadata get first-master-hostname
   ncn-m002
   ```

   If the node returned is not the one being rebuilt, proceed to the step which [stops etcd](#stop-etcd) and skip the substeps here.

   1. Reconfigure the Boot Script Service \(BSS\) to point to a new first master node.

      Run this step on a master or worker node that is not being rebuilt.

      ```bash
      ncn# cray bss bootparameters list --name Global --format=json | jq '.[]' > Global.json
      ```

   1. Edit the Global.json file and edit the indicated line.

      Change the `first-master-hostname` value to another node that will be promoted to the first master node. In this case, the first node is changing from `ncn-m002` to `ncn-m001`, so the line would be changed to the following:

      ```bash
      "first-master-hostname": "ncn-m001",
      ```

   1. Get a token to interact with BSS via the REST API.

      ```bash
      ncn# curl -i -s -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                 -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
                 "https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/bss/boot/v1/bootparameters" \
                 -X PUT -d @./Global.json
      ```

      Ensure a good response, such as `HTTP CODE 200`, is returned in the `curl` output.

   1. Configure the newly promoted first master node so it is able to have other nodes join the cluster.

      Use `ssh` to login to the newly-promoted master node chosen in the previous steps \(`ncn-m001` in this case\),
      copy/paste the following script to a file, and then execute it.

      ```bash
      #!/bin/bash

      source /srv/cray/scripts/metal/lib.sh
      export KUBERNETES_VERSION="v$(cat /etc/cray/kubernetes/version)"
      echo $(kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs 2>&1 | tail -1) > /etc/cray/kubernetes/certificate-key
      export CERTIFICATE_KEY=$(cat /etc/cray/kubernetes/certificate-key)
      export MAX_PODS_PER_NODE=$(craysys metadata get kubernetes-max-pods-per-node)
      export PODS_CIDR=$(craysys metadata get kubernetes-pods-cidr)
      export SERVICES_CIDR=$(craysys metadata get kubernetes-services-cidr)
      envsubst < /srv/cray/resources/common/kubeadm.yaml > /etc/cray/kubernetes/kubeadm.yaml

      kubeadm token create --print-join-command > /etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command 2>/dev/null
      echo "$(cat /etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command) --control-plane --certificate-key $(cat /etc/cray/kubernetes/certificate-key)" > /etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command-control-plane

      mkdir -p /srv/cray/scripts/kubernetes
      cat > /srv/cray/scripts/kubernetes/token-certs-refresh.sh <<'EOF'
      #!/bin/bash

      if [[ "$1" != "skip-upload-certs" ]]; then
        kubeadm init phase upload-certs --upload-certs --config /etc/cray/kubernetes/kubeadm.yaml
      fi
      kubeadm token create --print-join-command > /etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command 2>/dev/null
      echo "$(cat /etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command) --control-plane --certificate-key $(cat /etc/cray/kubernetes/certificate-key)" \
        > /etc/cray/kubernetes/join-command-control-plane

      EOF
      chmod +x /srv/cray/scripts/kubernetes/token-certs-refresh.sh
      /srv/cray/scripts/kubernetes/token-certs-refresh.sh skip-upload-certs
      echo "0 */1 * * * root /srv/cray/scripts/kubernetes/token-certs-refresh.sh >> /var/log/cray/cron.log 2>&1" > /etc/cron.d/cray-k8s-token-certs-refresh
      ```

1. Find the line with the name of the master being removed. The member ID is the alphanumeric string in the first field of that line. The IP address is in the URL in the fourth field in the line. Note the member ID and IP address for use in subsequent steps.

   ```bash
   ncn# etcdctl --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
       --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt  \
       --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.key --endpoints=localhost:2379 member list
   ```

1. Remove the master node from the etcd cluster backing Kubernetes.

   Replace the `MEMBER_ID` value with the value returned in the previous sub-step.

   ```bash
   ncn# etcdctl --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
       --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.key \
       --endpoints=localhost:2379 member remove <MEMBER_ID>
   ```
   <a name="stop-etcd"></a>
1. Stop the etcd service **on the master node being removed**.

   ```bash
   NODE# systemctl stop etcd.service
   ```

1. Remove the node from the Kubernetes cluster. This command should not be run on the node being deleted.

   ```bash
   ncn# kubectl delete node NODE
   ```
   
1. Add the node back into the etcd cluster so when it reboots it can rejoin. The IP and hostname of the rebuilt node is needed for the following command. Replace the `NCN-M_HOSTNAME` and `IP_ADDRESS` address values. Use the IP address you noted in an earlier step from the `etcdctl` command.

   ```bash
   ncn# etcdctl --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
           --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.key --endpoints=localhost:2379 member add NCN-M_HOSTNAME \
           --peer-urls=https://IP_ADDRESS:2380
   ```

<a name="prepare-storage-node"></a>

#### 1.3. Prepare Storage Node

Prepare a storage node before rebuilding it.

Skip this section if rebuilding a master or worker node. The examples in this section assume the storage node with a hostname of `NODE` and component name of `XNAME` is being rebuilt.

1. Retrieve the `XNAME` for the node being removed.

   This xname is available on the node being rebuilt in the following file:

   ```bash
   ncn# ssh NODE cat /etc/cray/xname
   ```

1. Confirm what the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) configurationStatus is for the desiredConfig before shutting down the node.

    The following command will indicate if a CFS job is currently in progress for this node. Replace the `XNAME` value in the following command with the xname of the node being rebuilt.

    ```bash
    ncn# cray cfs components describe XNAME --format json
    {
      "configurationStatus": "configured",
      "desiredConfig": "ncn-personalization-full",
      "enabled": true,
      "errorCount": 0,
      "id": "x3000c0s7b0n0",
      "retryPolicy": 3,
    ```

    If the configurationStatus is `pending`, wait for the job finish before rebooting this node. If the configurationStatus is `failed`, this means the failed CFS job configurationStatus preceded this worker rebuild, and that can be addressed independent of rebuilding this worker. If the configurationStatus is `unconfigured` and the NCN personalization procedure has not been done as part of an install yet, this can be ignored.

1. Check the status of Ceph.

    Check the OSD status, weight, and location:

    ```bash
    ncn-s# ceph osd tree
    ID CLASS WEIGHT   TYPE NAME         STATUS REWEIGHT PRI-AFF
    -1       20.95917 root default
    -3        6.98639     host ncn-s001
     2   ssd  1.74660         osd.2         up  1.00000 1.00000
     5   ssd  1.74660         osd.5         up  1.00000 1.00000
     8   ssd  1.74660         osd.8         up  1.00000 1.00000
    11   ssd  1.74660         osd.11        up  1.00000 1.00000
    -7        6.98639     host ncn-s002
     0   ssd  1.74660         osd.0         up  1.00000 1.00000
     4   ssd  1.74660         osd.4         up  1.00000 1.00000
     7   ssd  1.74660         osd.7         up  1.00000 1.00000
    10   ssd  1.74660         osd.10        up  1.00000 1.00000
    -5        6.98639     host ncn-s003
     1   ssd  1.74660         osd.1       down        0 1.00000
     3   ssd  1.74660         osd.3       down        0 1.00000
     6   ssd  1.74660         osd.6       down        0 1.00000
     9   ssd  1.74660         osd.9       down        0 1.00000
    ```

    Check the status of the Ceph cluster:

    ```bash
    ncn-s# ceph -s
      cluster:
        id:     22d01fcd-a75b-4bfc-b286-2ed8645be2b5
        health: HEALTH_WARN
                4 osds down
                1 host (8 osds) down
                Degraded data redundancy: 923/2768 objects degraded (33.345%), 94 pgs degraded
                1/3 mons down, quorum ncn-s001,ncn-s002

      services:
        mon: 3 daemons, quorum ncn-s001,ncn-s002 (age 43s), out of quorum: ncn-s003
        mgr: ncn-s001(active, since 18h), standbys: ncn-s002
        mds: cephfs:1 {0=ncn-s001=up:active} 1 up:standby
        osd: 16 osds: 8 up (since 34s), 12 in (since 34m)
        rgw: 2 daemons active (ncn-s001.rgw0, ncn-s002.rgw0)

      task status:
        scrub status:
            mds.ncn-s001: idle

      data:
        pools:   10 pools, 480 pgs
        objects: 923 objects, 29 KiB
        usage:   12 GiB used, 21 TiB / 21 TiB avail
        pgs:     923/2768 objects degraded (33.345%)
                 369 active+undersized
                 94  active+undersized+degraded
                 17  active+clean
    ```

1. If the node is a ceph-mon node, remove it from the mon map.

    Skip this step if the node is not a ceph-mon node.

    The output in the previous sub-step indicated `out of quorum: ncn-s003`.

    ```bash
    ncn-s001# ceph mon dump
    dumped monmap epoch 5
    epoch 5
    fsid 22d01fcd-a75b-4bfc-b286-2ed8645be2b5

    1: [v2:10.252.1.10:3300/0,v1:10.252.1.10:6789/0] mon.ncn-s002
    2: [v2:10.252.1.11:3300/0,v1:10.252.1.11:6789/0] mon.ncn-s003

    ```

    Remove the out of quorum node from the mon map. Replace the NODE value with the name of the known down ceph-mon node.

    ```bash
    ncn-s001# cd /etc/ansible/ceph-ansible
    ncn-s001# ceph mon rm NODE
    removing mon.ncn-s003 at [v2:10.252.1.11:3300/0,v1:10.252.1.11:6789/0], there will be 2 monitors
    ```

    The Ceph cluster will now show as healthy. However, there will now only be two monitors, which is not an ideal situation because if there is another Ceph mon outage then the cluster will go read-only.

    ```bash
    ncn-s001# ceph -s
      cluster:
        id:     22d01fcd-a75b-4bfc-b286-2ed8645be2b5
        health: HEALTH_WARN
                Degraded data redundancy: 588/2771 objects degraded (21.220%), 60 pgs degraded, 268 pgs undersized

                 74  active+clean
                 60  active+undersized+degraded
    ```

1. Remove Ceph OSDs.

    The `ceph osd tree` capture indicated that there are down OSDs on `ncn-s003`.

    ```bash
    -5        6.98639     host ncn-s003
     1   ssd  1.74660         osd.1       down        0 1.00000
     3   ssd  1.74660         osd.3       down        0 1.00000
     6   ssd  1.74660         osd.6       down        0 1.00000
     9   ssd  1.74660         osd.9       down        0 1.00000
    ```

    Remove the OSDs to prevent the install from creating new OSDs on the drives, but there is still a reference to them in the crush map. It will time out trying to restart the old OSDs because of that reference.

    Replace NODE with the host you are removing.

    ```bash
    # for osd in $(ceph osd ls-tree NODE); do ceph osd destroy osd.$osd \
        --force; ceph osd purge osd.$osd --force; done
    destroyed osd.1
    purged osd.1
    destroyed osd.3
    purged osd.3
    destroyed osd.6
    purged osd.6
    destroyed osd.9
    purged osd.9
    ```

1. Remove the node from the crush map.

    ```bash
    # ceph osd crush rm <hostname>
    ```

#### 2. Identify Nodes and Update Metadata

This section applies to all node types. The examples in this section assume the node with a hostname of `NODE` and component name of `XNAME` is being rebuilt.

<a name="identify-retrieve"></a>

1. Retrieve the xname for the node being removed.

   This xname is available on the node being rebuilt in the following file:

   ```bash
   ncn# ssh NODE cat /etc/cray/xname
   ```

   Note the xname for use in subsequent steps.

1. Generate the Boot Script Service \(BSS\) boot parameters JSON file for modification and review.

   Replace the XNAME value with the value retrieved in the previous step.

   ```bash
   ncn# cray bss bootparameters list --name XNAME --format=json > XNAME.json
   ```

<a name="inspect"></a>
1. Inspect and modify the JSON file.
   1. Remove the outer array brackets.

      Do this by removing the first and last line of the XNAME.json file, indicated with the '\[' and '\]' brackets.

   1. Remove the leading whitespace on the new first and last lines.

      On the new first and last lines of the file, removing all whitespace characters at the beginning of those lines. The first
      line should now just be a '\{' character and the last line should now just be a '\}' character.

   1. Ensure the current boot parameters are appropriate for PXE booting.

      Inspect the `"params": "kernel..."` line. If the line begins with `BOOT_IMAGE` and/or does not contain `metal.server`, the following steps are needed:

      1. Remove everything before `kernel` on the `"params": "kernel"` line.
      1. Re-run steps [Retrieve the xname and Generate BSS JSON](#identify-retrieve) for another node/xname. Look for an example that does not contain `BOOT_IMAGE`.

          Once an example is found, copy a portion of the `params` line for everything including and after `biosdevname`, and use that in the `XNAME.json` file.

      1. After copying the content after `biosdevname`, change the `"hostname=<hostname>"` to the correct host.

1. Set the kernel parameters to wipe the disk.

   Locate the portion of the line that contains `"metal.no-wipe"` and ensure it is set to zero `"metal.no-wipe=0"`.

1. Re-apply the boot parameters list for the node using the XNAME.json file.

   1. Get a token to interact with BSS using the REST API.

       ```bash
       ncn# TOKEN=$(curl -s -k -S -d grant_type=client_credentials \
       -d client_id=admin-client -d client_secret=`kubectl get secrets admin-client-auth \
       -o jsonpath='{.data.client-secret}' | base64 -d` \
       https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/keycloak/realms/shasta/protocol/openid-connect/token \
       | jq -r '.access_token')
       ```

   1. Do a PUT action for the new JSON file.

       Replace the XNAME value before running the following command.

       ```bash
       ncn# curl -i -s -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
       "https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/bss/boot/v1/bootparameters" -X PUT -d @./XNAME.json
       ```

       Ensure a good response \(`HTTP CODE 200`\) is returned in the output.

1. Verify the `bss bootparameters list` command returns the expected information.

   1. Export the list from BSS to a file with a different name.

      Replace the XNAME value before running the following command.

      ```bash
      ncn# cray bss bootparameters list --name XNAME --format=json > XNAME.check.json
      ```

   1. Compare the new JSON file with what was PUT to BSS.

      Replace the XNAME value before running the following command.

      ```bash
      ncn# diff XNAME.json XNAME.check.json
      ```

      The only difference between the files should be the square brackets that were removed from the XNAME.json file, and the whitespace changes on the first and last lines with curly braces. Expected output will look similar to:

      ```
      1,2c1
      < [
      <   {
      ---
      > {
      47,48c46
      <   }
      < ]
      ---
      > }
      ```

1. Watch the console for the node being rebuilt.

   Login to a second session to use it to watch the console using the instructions in the following document: [Log in to a Node Using ConMan](../conman/Log_in_to_a_Node_Using_ConMan.md). The first session will be needed to run the commands in the following Rebuild Node steps.

<a name="rebuild_node"></a>

#### 3. Rebuild Node

Only follow the steps in the section for the node type that is being rebuilt:

- [Rebuild Node: Master or Worker Node](#rebuild_master_worker)
- [Rebuild Node: Storage Node](#rebuild_storage)

<a name="rebuild_master_worker"></a>

##### 3.1. Rebuild Node: Master or Worker

This section applies to master and worker nodes. Skip this section if rebuilding a storage node. All commands in this section must be run on any master or worker node that is already in the cluster and is not being rebuilt \(unless otherwise indicated\).

1. Wipe the disks on the node being rebuilt.

    This can be done from the ConMan console window.

    **Warning:** This is the point of no return. Once the disks are wiped,the node must be rebuilt.

    ```
    NODE# mdisks=$(lsblk -l -o SIZE,NAME,TYPE,TRAN | grep -E '(sata|nvme|sas)' | sort -h | awk '{print "/dev/" $2}')
    NODE# wipefs --all --force $mdisks
    ```

1. Set the PXE boot option and power cycle the node.

   1. Set the BMC variable to the hostname of the BMC of the node being rebuilt.

      ```bash
      ncn# export BMC=<NCN name>-mgmt
      ```

      For example, if you are rebuilding ncn-w003, this would be `ncn-w003-mgmt`.

   1. Export the root password of the BMC.

      ```bash
      ncn# export IPMI_PASSWORD=changeme
      ```

   1. Set the PXE/efiboot option.

      ```bash
      ncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -E -H $BMC chassis bootdev pxe options=efiboot
      ```

   1. Power off the node.

      ```bash
      ncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -E -H $BMC chassis power off
      ```

   1. Verify that the node is off.
   
      ```bash
      ncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -E -H $BMC chassis power status
      ```

      Ensure the power is reporting as off. This may take 5-10 seconds for this to update. Wait about 30 seconds after receiving the correct power status before issuing the next command.

   1. Power on the node.

      ```bash
      ncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -E -H $BMC chassis power on
      ```

   1. Verify that the node is on.

      Ensure the power is reporting as on. This may take 5-10 seconds for this to update.

      ```bash
      ncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -E -H $BMC chassis power status
      ```

1. Observe the boot.

    After a bit, the node should begin to boot. This can be viewed from the ConMan console window. Eventually, there will be a `NBP file...` message in the console output which indicates that the PXE boot has begun the TFTP download of the ipxe program. Later messages will appear as the Linux kernel loads and then the scripts in the initrd begin to run, including cloud-init.

   Wait until cloud-init displays messages similar to these on the console to indicate that cloud-init has finished with the module called `modules:final`.

   ```
   [  295.466827] cloud-init[9333]: Cloud-init v. 20.2-8.45.1 running 'modules:final' at Thu, 26 Aug 2021 15:23:20 +0000. Up 125.72 seconds.
   [  295.467037] cloud-init[9333]: Cloud-init v. 20.2-8.45.1 finished at Thu, 26 Aug 2021 15:26:12 +0000. Datasource DataSourceNoCloudNet [seed=cmdline,http://10.92.100.81:8888/][dsmode=net].  Up 295.46 seconds
   ```

   Then press return on the console to ensure that the the login prompt is displayed including the correct hostname of this node. Then exit the ConMan console (**&** then **.**), and then use `ssh` to log in to the node to complete the remaining validation steps.

    **Troubleshooting:** If the `NBP file...` output never appears, or something else goes wrong, go back to the steps for modifying XNAME.json file (see the step to [inspect and modify the JSON file](#inspect)) and make sure these instructions were completed correctly.

   **Master nodes only** if cloud-init did not complete the newly-rebuilt node will need to have its etcd service definition manually updated. Reconfigure the etcd service, and restart the cloud init on the newly rebuilt master:

   ```bash
   NODE# systemctl stop etcd.service; sed -i 's/new/existing/' \
           /etc/systemd/system/etcd.service /srv/cray/resources/common/etcd/etcd.service; \
           systemctl daemon-reload ; rm -rf /var/lib/etcd/member; \
           systemctl start etcd.service; /srv/cray/scripts/common/kubernetes-cloudinit.sh
   ```

1. Confirm vlan004 is up with the correct IP address on the rebuilt node.

    The following examples assume the NCN/hostname is `NODE`.

    1. Find the desired IP address.

        ```bash
        NODE# dig +short NODE.hmn
        10.254.1.16
        ```

    1. Confirm the output from the dig command matches the interface.

        If the IP addresses match, proceed to the next step. If they do not match, continue with the following sub-steps.

        ```bash
        NODE# ip addr show vlan004
        14: vlan004@bond0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
            link/ether b8:59:9f:2b:2f:9e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
            inet 10.254.1.16/17 brd 10.254.127.255 scope global vlan004
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
            inet6 fe80::ba59:9fff:fe2b:2f9e/64 scope link
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        ```

       1. Change the IP address for vlan004 if necessary.

           ```bash
           NODE# vim /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-vlan004
           ```

           Set the IPADDR line to the correct IP address with a `/17` mask.

           ```bash
           IPADDR='10.254.1.16/17'
           ```

    1. Restart the vlan004 network interface.

        ```bash
        NODE# wicked ifreload vlan004
        ```

    1. Confirm the output from the dig command matches the interface.

        ```bash
        NODE# ip addr show vlan004
        ```

1. Confirm that vlan007 is up with the correct IP address on the rebuilt node.

    The following examples assume the NCN/hostname is `NODE`.

    1. Find the desired IP address.

        ```bash
        NODE# dig +short NODE.can
        10.103.8.11
        ```

    1. Confirm the output from the dig command matches the interface.

        If the IP addresses match, proceed to the next step. If they do not match, continue with the following sub-steps.

        ```bash
        NODE# ip addr show vlan007
        15: vlan007@bond0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
            link/ether b8:59:9f:2b:2f:9e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
            inet 10.103.8.11/24 brd 10.103.8.255 scope global vlan007
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
            inet6 fe80::ba59:9fff:fe2b:2f9e/64 scope link
               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        ```

       1. Change the IP address for vlan007 if necessary.

           ```bash
           NODE# vim /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-vlan007
           ```

           Set the IPADDR line to the correct IP address with a `/24` mask.

           ```bash
           IPADDR='10.103.8.11/24'
           ```

    1. Restart the vlan007 network interface.

        ```bash
        NODE# wicked ifreload vlan007
        ```

    1. Confirm the output from the dig command matches the interface.

        ```bash
        NODE# ip addr show vlan007
        ```

1. Verify the new node is in the cluster.

    Run the following command several times to watch for the newly rebuilt node to join the cluster. This should occur within 10 to 20 minutes.

    ```bash
    ncn# kubectl get nodes
    NAME       STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
    ncn-m001   Ready    master   113m   v1.18.6
    ncn-m002   Ready    master   113m   v1.18.6
    ncn-m003   Ready    master   112m   v1.18.6
    ncn-w001   Ready    <none>   112m   v1.18.6
    ncn-w002   Ready    <none>   112m   v1.18.6
    ncn-w003   Ready    <none>   112m   v1.18.6
    ```

1. Set the wipe flag back so it will not wipe the disk when the node is rebooted.

    1. Edit the XNAME.json file and set the `metal.no-wipe=1` value.

    1. Do a PUT action for the edited JSON file.

        ```bash
        ncn# curl -i -s -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" \
        "https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/bss/boot/v1/bootparameters" \
        -X PUT -d @./XNAME.json
        ```

    The output from the ncnHealthChecks.sh script \(run later in the "Validation" steps\) can be used to verify what `metal.no-wipe` value has been set on every NCN.

1. Ensure there is proper routing set up for liquid-cooled hardware.

##### 3.2. Rebuild Node: Storage

This section applies to storage nodes. Skip this section if rebuilding a master or worker node. All commands in this section must be run on any storage node that is already in the cluster and is not being rebuilt \(unless otherwise indicated\).

1. Wipe the disks on the node being rebuilt.

   This can be done from the ConMan console window.

   1. Delete CEPH Volumes

      ```bash
      NODE# systemctl stop ceph-osd.target
      ```

   1. Make sure the OSDs (if any) are not running after running the first command.

      ```bash
      NODE# ls -1 /dev/sd* /dev/disk/by-label/*
      NODE# vgremove -f --select 'vg_name=~ceph*'
      ```

1. Wipe the disks and RAIDs.

   **Warning:** This is the point of no return. Once the disks are wiped,the node must be rebuilt.

   ```
   NODE# wipefs --all --force /dev/sd* /dev/disk/by-label/*
   ```

1. Set the PXE boot option and power cycle the node.

   1. Set the BMC variable to the hostname of the BMC of the node being rebuilt.

      ```bash
      ncn# export BMC=<NCN name>-mgmt
      ```

      For example, if you are rebuilding ncn-s003, this would be `ncn-s003-mgmt`.

   1. Export the root password of the BMC.

      ```bash
      ncn# export IPMI_PASSWORD=changeme
      ```

   1. Set the PXE/efiboot option.

      ```bash
      ncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -E -H $BMC chassis bootdev pxe options=efiboot
      ```

   1. Power off the node.

      ```bash
      ncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -E -H $BMC chassis power off
      ```

   1. Verify that the node is off.


      ```bash
      ncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -E -H $BMC chassis power status
      ```

      Ensure the power is reporting as off. This may take 5-10 seconds for this to update. Wait about 30 seconds after receiving the correct power status before issuing the next command.

   1. Power on the node.

      ```bash
      ncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -E -H $BMC chassis power on
      ```

   1. Verify that the node is on.

      Ensure the power is reporting as on. This may take 5-10 seconds for this to update.

      ```bash
      ncn# ipmitool -I lanplus -U root -E -H $BMC chassis power status
      ```

1. Observe the boot.

    After a bit, the node should begin to boot. This can be viewed from the ConMan console window.

1. Confirm vlan004 is up with the correct IP address on the rebuilt node.

    The following examples assume the NCN/hostname is `NODE`.

    1. Find the desired IP address.

        ```bash
        NODE# dig +short NODE.hmn
        10.254.1.16
        ```

    1. Confirm the output from the dig command matches the interface.

        If the IP addresses match, proceed to the next step. If they do not match, continue with the following sub-steps.

        ```bash
        NODE# ip addr show vlan004
        14: vlan004@bond0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000
            link/ether b8:59:9f:2b:2f:9e brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff

               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        ```

       1. Change the IP address for vlan004 if necessary.

           ```bash
           NODE# vim /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-vlan004
           ```

           Set the IPADDR line to the correct IP address with a `/17` mask.

           ```bash
           IPADDR='10.254.1.16/17'
           ```

    1. Restart the vlan004 network interface.

        ```bash
        NODE# wicked ifreload vlan004
        ```

    1. Confirm the output from the dig command matches the interface.

        ```bash
        NODE# ip addr show vlan004
        ```

1. Confirm that vlan007 is up with the correct IP address on the rebuilt node.

    The following examples assume the NCN/hostname is `NODE`.

    1. Find the desired IP address.

        ```bash
        NODE# dig +short NODE.can
        10.103.8.11
        ```

    1. Confirm the output from the dig command matches the interface.

        If the IP addresses match, proceed to the next step. If they do not match, continue with the following sub-steps.

        ```bash
        NODE# ip addr show vlan007
        15: vlan007@bond0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state UP group default qlen 1000

               valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
        ```

       1. Change the IP address for vlan007 if necessary.

           ```bash
           NODE# vim /etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-vlan007
           ```

           Set the IPADDR line to the correct IP address with a `/24` mask.

           ```bash
           IPADDR='10.103.8.11/24'
           ```

    1. Restart the vlan007 network interface.

        ```bash
        NODE# wicked ifreload vlan007
        ```

    1. Confirm the output from the dig command matches the interface.

        ```bash
        NODE# ip addr show vlan007
        ```

1. Use `ssh` to log in to the node where Ansible will run.

    -   If rebuilding `ncn-s001`, log in to either `ncn-s002` or `ncn-s003`.

        In the following storage node example steps, `ncn-s001` is being rebuilt, so `ncn-s002` is the node being used.

    -   If rebuilding any other storage node, log in to `ncn-s001` and proceed to the next step.

1. Update the Ansible inventory.

    1. Update the number of the last storage node.

        There will be no output returned from the following commands. This step changes LASTNODE into the number of the last storage node. In this example, LASTNODE is changed to `ncn-s003`.

        ```bash
        ncn-s002# source /srv/cray/scripts/common/fix_ansible_inv.sh
        ncn-s002# fix_inventory
        ```

    1. Verify the Ansible inventory was changed.

        Verify that LASTNODE no longer exists in the inventory file \(`/etc/ansible/hosts`\).

        ```bash
        [all]
        ncn-s[001:LASTNODE].nmn

        [ceph_all]
        ncn-s[001:LASTNODE].nmn

        to:

        [all]
        ncn-s[001:003].nmn

        [ceph_all]
        ncn-s[001:003].nmn
        ```

1. Set the environment variable for the rados gateway vip.

    ```bash
    ncn-s002# cd /etc/ansible/group_vars
    ncn-s002# export RGW_VIRTUAL_IP=$(craysys metadata get rgw-virtual-ip)
    ncn-s002# echo $RGW_VIRTUAL_IP
    10.252.1.3
    ```

1. Run the ceph-ansible playbook to reinstall the node and bring it back into the cluster.

    The following example shows it running for `ncn-s001`, but where Ansible is running from is dependent on which storage node needs to be rebuilt.

    ```bash
    ncn-s001# cd /etc/ansible/ceph-ansible
    ncn-s001# ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/ceph-ansible/site.yml
    ```

1. Open another SSH session to a storage node that is not currently being rebuilt, and then monitor the build.

    ```bash
    ncn-s002# watch ceph -s
    ```

1. Run the radosgw-sts-setup.yml Ansible play on `ncn-s001`.

    Ensure Ceph is healthy and the ceph-ansible playbook has finished before running the following Ansible play.

    ```bash
    ncn-s001# ansible-playbook /etc/ansible/ceph-rgw-users/radosgw-sts-setup.yml
    ```

    On the node that has been rebuilt, verify the sts values are in the ceph.conf file.

    ```bash
    ncn-s001# grep sts /etc/ceph/ceph.conf
    rgw_s3_auth_use_sts = True
    rgw_sts_key = <REDACTED_KEY>
    ```

1. Set the wipe flag back so it will not wipe the disk when the node is rebooted.
    1. Edit the XNAME.json file and set the `metal.no-wipe=1` value.

    1. Do a PUT action for the edited JSON file.

        ```bash
        ncn# curl -i -s -k -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
                -H "Authorization: Bearer $\{TOKEN\}" \
                "https://api-gw-service-nmn.local/apis/bss/boot/v1/bootparameters" \
                -X PUT -d @./XNAME.json
        ```

    The output from the ncnHealthChecks.sh script \(run later in the "Validation" steps\) can be used to verify what `metal.no-wipe` value has been set on every NCN.

#### 4. Validation

Only follow the steps in the section for the node type that was rebuilt:

- [Validate Worker Node](#validate_worker_node)
- [Validate Master Node](#validate_master_node)
- [Validate Storage Node](#validate_storage_node)

<a name="validate_worker_node"></a>

##### 4.1. Validate Worker Node

Validate the worker node rebuilt successfully.

Skip this section if a master or storage node was rebuilt. The examples in this section assume the worker node with a hostname of `NODE` and component name of `XNAME` was rebuilt.

   1. Verify the new node is in the cluster.

      Run the following command from any master or worker node that is already in the cluster. It is helpful to run this command several times to watch for the newly rebuilt node to join the cluster. This should occur within 10 to 20 minutes.

      ```bash
      ncn-m# kubectl get nodes
      NAME       STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
      ncn-m001   Ready    master   113m   v1.18.6
      ncn-m002   Ready    master   113m   v1.18.6
      ncn-m003   Ready    master   112m   v1.18.6
      ncn-w001   Ready    <none>   112m   v1.18.6
      ncn-w002   Ready    <none>   112m   v1.18.6
      ncn-w003   Ready    <none>   112m   v1.18.6
      ```

   1. Confirm /var/lib/containerd is on overlay on the node which was rebooted.

      ```bash
      ncn# ssh NODE
      NODE# df -h /var/lib/containerd
      Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
      containerd_overlayfs  378G  245G  133G  65% /var/lib/containerd
      ```

      After several minutes of the node joining the cluster, pods should be in a `Running` state for the worker node.

   1. Confirm the pods are beginning to get scheduled and reach a Running state on the worker node.

      ```bash
      ncn-m001# kubectl get po -A -o wide | grep NODE
      ```

   1. Confirm BGP is healthy.

      Follow the steps in the [Check BGP Status and Reset Sessions](../network/metallb_bgp/Check_BGP_Status_and_Reset_Sessions.md) to verify and fix BGP if needed.

   1. Retrieve the `XNAME` for the node being rebuilt.

      This xname is available on the node being rebuilt in the following file:

      ```bash
      ncn# ssh NODE cat /etc/cray/xname
      ```

   1. Confirm what the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) configurationStatus is for the desiredConfig after rebooting the node.

      The following command will indicate if a CFS job is currently in progress for this node. Replace the `XNAME` value in the following command with the xname of the node being rebuilt.

      ```bash
      ncn# cray cfs components describe XNAME --format json
      {
        "configurationStatus": "configured",
        "desiredConfig": "ncn-personalization-full",
        "enabled": true,
        "errorCount": 0,
        "id": "x3000c0s7b0n0",
        "retryPolicy": 3,
      ```

      If the configurationStatus is `pending`, wait for the job to finish before continuing. If the configurationStatus is `failed`, this means the failed CFS job configurationStatus should be addressed now for this node. If the configurationStatus is `unconfigured` and the NCN personalization procedure has not been done as part of an install yet, this can be ignored.
      If configurationStatus is `failed`, See [Troubleshoot Ansible Play Failures in CFS Sessions](../configuration_management/Troubleshoot_Ansible_Play_Failures_in_CFS_Sessions.md) for how to analyze the pod logs from cray-cfs to determine why the configuration may not have completed.

   1. Redeploy the cray-cps-cm-pm pod.

      This step is only required if the `cray-cps-cm-pm` pod was running on the node before it was rebuilt.
      > The Content Projection Service (CPS) is part of the COS product so if this worker node is being rebuilt before the COS product has been installed, CPS will not be installed yet.

      ```bash
      ncn-m001# cray cps deployment update --nodes "ncn-w001,ncn-w002"
      ```

   1. Collect data about the system management platform health \(can be run from a master or worker NCN\).

      ```bash
      ncn# /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnHealthChecks.sh
      ncn# /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnPostgresHealthChecks.sh
      ```

<a name="validate_master_node"></a>

##### 4.2. Validate Master Node

Validate the master node rebuilt successfully.

Skip this section if a worker or storage node was rebuilt. The examples in this section assume the master node with a hostname of `NODE` and component name of `XNAME` was rebuilt.

   1. Verify the new node is in the cluster.

      Run the following command from any master or worker node that is already in the cluster. It is helpful to run this command several times to watch for the newly rebuilt node to join the cluster. This should occur within 10 to 20 minutes.

      ```bash
      ncn# kubectl get nodes
      NAME       STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
      ncn-m001   Ready    master   113m   v1.18.6
      ncn-m002   Ready    master   113m   v1.18.6
      ncn-m003   Ready    master   112m   v1.18.6
      ncn-w001   Ready    <none>   112m   v1.18.6
      ncn-w002   Ready    <none>   112m   v1.18.6
      ncn-w003   Ready    <none>   112m   v1.18.6
      ```

   1. Confirm the `sdc` disk has the correct lvm on the rebuilt node.

       ```bash
       ncn# ssh NODE
       NODE# lsblk | grep -A2 ^sdc
       sdc                   8:32   0 447.1G  0 disk
        └─ETCDLVM           254:0    0 447.1G  0 crypt
          └─etcdvg0-ETCDK8S 254:1    0    32G  0 lvm   /run/lib-etcd
       ```

   1. Confirm etcd is running and shows the node as a member once again.

       The newly built master node should be in the returned list.

       ```bash
       ncn-m# etcdctl --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
                   --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.key --endpoints=localhost:2379 member list
       ```

   1. Retrieve the `XNAME` for the node being rebuilt.

      This xname is available on the node being rebuilt in the following file:

      ```bash
      ncn# ssh NODE cat /etc/cray/xname
      ```

   1. Confirm what the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) configurationStatus is for the desiredConfig after rebooting the node.

      The following command will indicate if a CFS job is currently in progress for this node. Replace the `XNAME` value in the following command with the xname of the node being rebuilt.

      ```bash
      ncn# cray cfs components describe XNAME --format json
      {
        "configurationStatus": "configured",
        "desiredConfig": "ncn-personalization-full",
        "enabled": true,
        "errorCount": 0,
        "id": "x3000c0s7b0n0",
        "retryPolicy": 3,
      ```

      If the configurationStatus is `pending`, wait for the job to finish before continuing. If the configurationStatus is `failed`, this means the failed CFS job configurationStatus should be addressed now for this node. If the configurationStatus is `unconfigured` and the NCN personalization procedure has not been done as part of an install yet, this can be ignored.
      If configurationStatus is `failed`, See [Troubleshoot Ansible Play Failures in CFS Sessions](../configuration_management/Troubleshoot_Ansible_Play_Failures_in_CFS_Sessions.md) for how to analyze the pod logs from cray-cfs to determine why the configuration may not have completed.

   1. Collect data about the system management platform health \(can be run from a master or worker NCN\).

        ```bash
        ncn# /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnHealthChecks.sh
        ncn# /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnPostgresHealthChecks.sh
        ```

<a name="validate_storage_node"></a>

##### 4.3. Validate Storage Node

Validate the storage node rebuilt successfully.

Skip this section if a master or worker node was rebuilt.

   1. Verify there are 3 mons, 3 mds, 3 mgr processes, and rgw.s

      ```bash
      ncn-m# ceph -s
        cluster:
          id:     22d01fcd-a75b-4bfc-b286-2ed8645be2b5
          health: HEALTH_OK

        services:
          mon: 3 daemons, quorum ncn-s001,ncn-s002,ncn-s003 (age 4m)
          mgr: ncn-s001(active, since 19h), standbys: ncn-s002, ncn-s003

          rgw: 3 daemons active (ncn-s001.rgw0, ncn-s002.rgw0, ncn-s003.rgw0)

        task status:
          scrub status:
              mds.ncn-s001: idle

        data:
          pools:   10 pools, 480 pgs
          objects: 926 objects, 31 KiB

          pgs:     480 active+clean
        ```

   1. Verify the OSDs are back in the cluster.

      ```bash
      ncn-m# ceph osd tree
      ID CLASS WEIGHT   TYPE NAME         STATUS REWEIGHT PRI-AFF
      -1       20.95917 root default

      ```

   1. Verify the radosgw and haproxy are correct.

      There will be an output \(without an error\) returned if radosgw and haproxy are correct.

      ```bash
      ncn# curl -k https://rgw-vip.nmn
      <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?><ListAllMyBucketsResult xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/ "><Owner><ID>anonymous</ID><DisplayName></DisplayName></Owner><Buckets></Buckets></ListAllMyBucketsResult
      ```

   1. Retrieve the `XNAME` for the node being rebuilt.

      This xname is available on the node being rebuilt in the following file:

      ```bash
      ncn# ssh NODE cat /etc/cray/xname
      ```

   1. Confirm what the Configuration Framework Service (CFS) configurationStatus is for the desiredConfig after rebooting the node.

      The following command will indicate if a CFS job is currently in progress for this node. Replace the `XNAME` value in the following command with the xname of the node being rebuilt.

      ```bash
      ncn# cray cfs components describe XNAME --format json
      {
        "configurationStatus": "configured",
        "desiredConfig": "ncn-personalization-full",
        "enabled": true,
        "errorCount": 0,
        "id": "x3000c0s7b0n0",
        "retryPolicy": 3,
      ```

      If the configurationStatus is `pending`, wait for the job to finish before continuing. If the configurationStatus is `failed`, this means the failed CFS job configurationStatus should be addressed now for this node. If the configurationStatus is `unconfigured` and the NCN personalization procedure has not been done as part of an install yet, this can be ignored.

      If configurationStatus is `failed`, See [Troubleshoot Ansible Play Failures in CFS Sessions](../configuration_management/Troubleshoot_Ansible_Play_Failures_in_CFS_Sessions.md) for how to analyze the pod logs from cray-cfs to determine why the configuration may not have completed.

   1. Collect data about the system management platform health \(can be run from a master or worker NCN\).

       ```bash
       ncn# /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnHealthChecks.sh
       ncn# /opt/cray/platform-utils/ncnPostgresHealthChecks.sh
       ```
